In its pure form, it is a very pale blue liquid that is slightly more viscous than water. It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent, and antiseptic, usually as a dilute solution (3%–6% by weight) in water for consumer use and in higher concentrations for industrial use. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or \"high-test peroxide\", decomposes explosively when heated and has been used as both a monopropellant and an oxidizer in rocketry.\\nHydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species and the simplest peroxide, a compound having an oxygen–oxygen single bond. It decomposes slowly into water and elemental oxygen when exposed to light, and rapidly in the presence of organic or reactive compounds. It is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution in an opaque bottle. Hydrogen peroxide is found in biological systems including the human body. Enzymes that use or decompose hydrogen peroxide are classified as peroxidases.']\nCompounds containing one or more phosphorus atoms in the P(V) oxidation state are important to chemistry, biology, and \nmedicine (Scheme 1A).1,2 These include marketed antiviral drugs such as such as Tenofovir alafenamide3 and Remdesivir, the \nlatter being an effective treatment for the Ebola virus4 which was also approved for use against SARSCoV2.5,6 Other relevant \ncompounds include Fosinopril,7 a compound used to treat hypertension and heart failure and WHO essential medicines listed \nchemotherapy agent Cyclophosphamide.8 In addition to being common APIs, P(V) containing compounds are also highly \nrelevant motifs in agrochemistry.9 A representative example is the herbicide Zytron developed by Dow.10 As such, the \ndevelopment of efficient methods for the preparation of enantioenriched P(V) containing compounds is crucial. pubchem: ['Name: Phosphorus\\nText:\\nPhosphorus, amorphous (red or violet) appears as red or dark crystals or powder.

All elemental forms of phosphorus are highly reactive and are therefore never found in nature. They can nevertheless be prepared artificially, the two most common ones being white phosphorus and red phosphorus. With 31P as its only stable isotope, phosphorus has an occurrence in Earth\\'s crust of about 0.1%, generally as phosphate rock. A member of the pnictogen family, phosphorus readily forms a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, with as its main oxidation states +5, +3 and -3.\\nThe isolation of white phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand marked the first \"discovery\" of an element not known since Antiquity. The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Its high toxicity makes exposure to white phosphorus very dangerous, while its flammability and pyrophoricity can be weaponized in the form of incendiaries. Red phosphorus is less dangerous and is used in matches and fire retardants.\\nMost industrial production of phosphorus is focused on the mining and transformation of phosphate rock into phosphoric acid for phosphate-based fertilisers. Phosphorus is an essential and often limiting nutrient for plants, and while natural levels are normally maintained over time by the phosphorus cycle, it is too slow for the regeneration of soil that undergoes intensive cultivation. As a consequence, these fertilisers are vital to modern agriculture. The leading producers of phosphate ore in 2024 were China, Morocco, the United States and Russia, with two-thirds of the estimated exploitable phosphate reserves worldwide in Morocco alone. Other applications of phosphorus compounds include pesticides, food additives, and detergents.\\nPhosphorus is essential to all known forms of life, largely through organophosphates, organic compounds containing the phosphate ion PO3−4 as a functional group. These include DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to the functioning of all cells. The main component of bones and teeth, bone mineral, is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, itself a phosphorus mineral.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Blatter's radical", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Blatter's radical", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Blatter's radical", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Phosphorus", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen Peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen Peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Blatter's radical", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen Peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen Peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nOver 170 sequences \nhave been annotated as PHD fingers in the human genome.3 They contain conserved regions of \ncysteine and histidine residues that coordinate two Zn2 ions in a cross braced fashion, with an \nantiparallel twostranded sheet core, which imposes conformational stability.37 These domains \nread a range of histone marks, notably the methylation state of the K4 residue of H3 histone \n(H3K4Me3, H3K4Me2 or H3K4Me0), and the H3K9 and H3R2 positions.8,9 Mutations within this \nmotif have been linked to immunological, neurological and developmental disorders.10,11 \n\n5 pubchem: ['Name: Histidine\\nText:\\nL-histidine is the L-enantiomer of the amino acid histidine. It has a role as a nutraceutical, a micronutrient, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a human metabolite, an algal metabolite and a mouse metabolite.

Histidine is also required for blood cell manufacture and protects tissues against damage caused by radiation and heavy metals. (NCI04)\\nHISTIDINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II (across all indications) and has 3 investigational indications.\\nHistidine is an alpha-amino acid with an imidazole functional group. It is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Histidine was first isolated by German physician Albrecht Kossel in 1896. Histidine is an essential amino acid in humans and other mammals. It was initially thought that it was only essential for infants, but longer-term studies established that it is also essential for adults. Infants four to six months old require 33 mg/kg of histidine. It is not clear how adults make small amounts of histidine, and dietary sources probably account for most of the histidine in the body. Histidine is a precursor for histamine and carnosine biosynthesis. Inborn errors of histidine metabolism exist and are marked by increased histidine levels in the blood. Elevated blood histidine is accompanied by a wide range of symptoms, from mental and physical retardation to poor intellectual functioning, emotional instability, tremor, ataxia and psychosis. Histidine and other imidazole compounds have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory properties  The efficacy of L-histidine in protecting inflamed tissue is attributed to the capacity of the imidazole ring to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by cells during acute inflammatory response  Histidine, when administered in therapeutic quantities is able to inhibit cytokines and growth factors involved in cell and tissue damage (US patent 6150392). Histidine in medical therapies has its most promising trials in rheumatoid arthritis where up to 4.5 g daily have been used effectively in severely affected patients. Arthritis patients have been found to have low serum histidine levels, apparently because of very rapid removal of histidine from their blood  Other patients besides arthritis patients that have been found to be low in serum histidine are those with chronic renal failure. Urinary levels of histidine are reduced in pediatric patients with pneumonia.  Asthma patients exhibit increased serum levels of histidine over normal controls   Serum histidine levels are lower and are negatively associated with inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women   Histidine supplementation has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, reduce BMI and fat mass and suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with metabolic syndrome.  Histidine appears to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, possibly via the NF-kappaB pathway, in adipocytes  Low plasma concentrations of histidine are associated with protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, and greater mortality in chronic kidney disease patients  Histidine may have many other possible functions because it is the precursor of the ubiquitous neurohormone-neurotransmitter histamine. Histidine increases histamine in the blood and probably in the brain. Low blood histamine with low serum histidine occurs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Low blood histamine also occurs in some manic, schizophrenic, high copper and hyperactive groups of psychiatric patients. Histidine is a useful therapy in all patients with low histamine levels.\\nAn essential amino acid that is required for the production of HISTAMINE.\\nSee also: Histidine Monohydrochloride (has salt form); Histidine Monohydrochloride Monohydrate (is active moiety of); Fenugreek seed (part of) ...

It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium.

Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. H2S arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes into contact with organic material, especially at high temperatures. Hydrogen sulfide is a covalent hydride chemically related to water (H2O) since oxygen and sulfur occur in the same periodic table group. It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps, and sewers (alongside the process of anaerobic digestion). It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. It is also important to note that Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle, the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth. As mentioned above, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules in the absence of oxygen by reducing sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids. Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel, oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using oxygen or nitrate as oxidant. The purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as electron donor in photosynthesis, thereby producing elemental sulfur.

It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater.\\nIt is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased CO2 concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change.\\nIts concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase.\\nCarbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the CO2 being released back into the atmosphere. CO2, or the carbon it holds, is eventually sequestered (stored for the long term) in rocks and organic deposits like coal, petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\nNearly all CO2 produced by humans goes into the atmosphere. Less than 1% of CO2 produced annually is put to commercial use, mostly in the fertilizer industry and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery. Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.:\\u200a3\"]\nGlobal climate changes represent a serious threat to humans. The Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) report expected that the mean global temperature will rise by 1.9 C in \n2100 (httpswww.ipcc.ch). It is estimated that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will \nbe increased to 950 ppm by 2100 (the present value of 400 ppm; httpswww.ipcc.ch). The \nchanges in the climate temperature are irreversible, causing a real threat to the environment and \nhumankind. The emission of gases is one of the most causes of global climate change111.

As a result, breath CH4 excretion can be used as an indicator of the in situ activity of the methanogenic flora. All CH4 produced in human beings is a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria, and about 50% of CH4 produced in the gut is absorbed and excreted in expired air. Because there appears to be no catabolism of this gas by other colonic organisms or host cells, breath CH4 measurements provide a rapid, simple means of semi quantitatively assessing the ongoing in situ metabolism of the methanogenic flora. It could seem likely that the intracolonic activity of a variety of bacteria similarly might be assessed quantitatively via analysis of expired air. However, the application of this methodology has been confounded by the rapid catabolism of many volatile bacterial products by other bacteria or human tissue. A striking aspect of the studies of breath CH4 measurements is the enormous individual variations in the excretion of this gas. Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult population do not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4. The remaining 34% of the adult population has appreciable breath methane concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm). On this basis the population can be divided into CH4 producers or nonproducers, although a more accurate term would be to define subjects as being low or high CH4 producers. The primary methanogen present in the human colon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, produces methane via a reaction that relies entirely on H2 produced by other organisms to reduce CO2 to CH4. Thus, breath CH4 concentrations might be expected to mirror breath H2 concentrations; however, the high levels of CH4 observed in the fasting state may result from H2 derived from endogenous rather than dietary substrates. A diverse assortment of conditions has been associated with a high prevalence of methane producers including diverticulosis, cystic fibrosis, high fasting serum cholesterol levels, encopresis in children, and aorto-iliac vascular disease, whereas obesity (measured as skin-fold thickness) was related inversely to methane production. The challenge that remains is to determine to what extent methanogens actively influence body physiology vs. simply serve as passive indicators of colonic function.

Proteins perform a number of critical functions as enzymes, structural proteins or hormones. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but there are some distinct differences.\\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases: transcription and translation. During transcription, a section of DNA encoding a protein, known as a gene, is converted into a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This conversion is carried out by enzymes, known as RNA polymerases, in the nucleus of the cell. In eukaryotes, this mRNA is initially produced in a premature form (pre-mRNA) which undergoes post-transcriptional modifications to produce mature mRNA. The mature mRNA is exported from the cell nucleus via nuclear pores to the cytoplasm of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the mRNA is read by ribosomes which use the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA to determine the sequence of amino acids. The ribosomes catalyze the formation of covalent peptide bonds between the encoded amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.\\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein; for example, to function as an enzyme the polypeptide chain must fold correctly to produce a functional active site. To adopt a functional three-dimensional shape, the polypeptide chain must first form a series of smaller underlying structures called secondary structures. The polypeptide chain in these secondary structures then folds to produce the overall 3D tertiary structure. Once correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different post-translational modifications, which can alter the protein's ability to function, its location within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and its ability to interact with other proteins.\\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease as changes and errors in this process, through underlying DNA mutations or protein misfolding, are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence. Mutations can cause the polypeptide chain to be shorter by generating a stop sequence which causes early termination of translation. Alternatively, a mutation in the mRNA sequence changes the specific amino acid encoded at that position in the polypeptide chain. This amino acid change can impact the protein's ability to function or to fold correctly. Misfolded proteins have a tendency to form dense protein clumps, which are often implicated in diseases, particularly neurological disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine (2DOS)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "2-deoxystreptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Coumarins, as a class, are comprised of numerous naturally occurring benzo-alpha-pyrone compounds with important and diverse physiological activities. The parent compound, coumarin, occurs naturally in many plants, natural spices, and foods such as tonka bean, cassia (bastard cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon), cinnamon, melilot (sweet clover), green tea, peppermint, celery, bilberry, lavender, honey (derived both from sweet clover and lavender), and carrots, as well as in beer, tobacco, wine, and other foodstuffs. Coumarin concentrations in these plants, spices, and foods range from <1 mg/kg in celery, 7000 mg/kg in cinnamon, and up to 87,000 mg/kg in cassia. An estimate of human exposure to coumarin from the diet has been calculated to be 0.02 mg/kg/day. Coumarin is used as an additive in perfumes and fragranced consumer products at concentrations ranging from <0.5% to 6.4% in fine fragrances to <0.01% in detergents. An estimate for systemic exposure of humans from the use of fragranced cosmetic products is 0.04 mg/kg BW/day, assuming complete dermal penetration. The use of coumarin as a food additive was banned by the FDA in 1954 based on reports of hepatotoxicity in rats. Due to its potential hepatotoxic effects in humans, the European Commission restricted coumarin from naturals as a direct food additive to 2 mg/kg food/day, with exceptions granting higher levels for alcoholic beverages, caramel, chewing gum, and certain 'traditional foods'. In addition to human exposure to coumarin from dietary sources and consumer products, coumarin is also used clinically as an antineoplastic and for the treatment of lymphedema and venous insufficiency. Exposure ranges from 11 mg/day for consumption of natural food ingredients to 7 g/day following clinical administration. Although adverse effects in humans following coumarin exposure are rare, and only associated with clinical doses, recent evidence indicates coumarin causes liver tumors in rats and mice and Clara cell toxicity and lung tumors in mice. The multiple effects as well as the ongoing human exposure to coumarin have resulted in a significant research effort focused on understanding the mechanism of coumarin induced toxicity/carcinogenicity and its human relevance. These investigations have revealed significant species differences in coumarin metabolism and toxicity such that the mechanism of coumarin induced effects in rodents, and the relevance of these findings for the safety assessment of coumarin exposure in humans are now better understood. In October 2004, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2004) reviewed coumarin to establish a tolerable daily intake (TDI) in foods. EFSA issued an opinion indicating that coumarin is not genotoxic, and that a threshold approach to safety assessment was most appropriate. EFSA recommended a TDI of 0 to 0.1 mg/kg BW/day. Including dietary contributions, the total human exposure is estimated to be 0.06 mg/kg/day. As a pharmaceutical, coumarin has been used in diverse applications with a wide variety of dosing regimens. Unlike coumadin and other coumarin derivatives, coumarin has no anti-coagulant activity. However, at low doses (typically 7 to 10 mg/day), coumarin has been used as a 'venotonic' to promote vein health and small venule blood flow. Additionally, coumarin has been used clinically in the treatment of high-protein lymphedema of various etiologies.

It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O2, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O2 (dioxygen). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV) light and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the atmosphere, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\\nOzone's odor is reminiscent of chlorine, and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 0.1 ppm in air. Ozone's O3 structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be weakly diamagnetic. At standard temperature and pressure, ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet-black solid. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures, physical shock, or fast warming to the boiling point. It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.\\nOzone is a powerful oxidizing agent (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.\"]\nAlthough \nphotocatalytic H2O2 peroxide production from pure water and oxygen has been \nreported, the reaction rates were usually too low to accumulate high concentrations of \nthe product,48 making the presence of additional electron donors like aliphatic or \naromatic alcohols practically indispensable to achieve reasonable reaction rates.911 \nNotably, this approach appears even more attractive if also the oxidation product of \nthis reaction has a higher value than the substrate, as it is the case for the conversion \nof biomassderived feedstock.1113 \nPolymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) whose photocatalytic activity was first reported by \nWang et al.14 are known for their excellent performance in lightdriven H2O2 production \nfrom oxygen.15 The ionic form of this material comprising stacks of 2D heptazinebased \nnetworks and alkali metal cations andor protons, poly(heptazine imide) (PHI),13, 1626 \notherwise known as CNxNCN, KSCN or alkali metal modified carbon nitride, typically \noutperforms the conventional, nonionic, melon polymer in this reaction.10, 27 The \nsuperior activity of PHI can be explained, among other factors, by partial substitution \nof the terminal NH2groups for NCN species in PHI, resulting in fewer hydrogen \nbond interactions and better dispersibility of the material in polar solvents.28 A major \nchallenge in carrying out such reactions in suspension is the effective separation of the \ndissolved reduction and oxidation products for their subsequent use, in order to avoid \nthe decomposition of H2O2 on the surface of the photocatalyst by photoredox \ndecomposition or by its disproportionation in the dark. pubchem: [\"Name: Hydrogen Peroxide\\nText:\\nHydrogen peroxide is a colorless liquid at room temperature with a bitter taste.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774.

Cell signaling is a fundamental property of all cellular life in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\\nTypically, the signaling process involves three components: the signal, the receptor, and the effector.\\nIn biology, signals are mostly chemical in nature, but can also be physical cues such as pressure, voltage, temperature, or light. Chemical signals are molecules with the ability to bind and activate a specific receptor. These molecules, also referred to as ligands, are chemically diverse, including ions (e.g. Na+, K+, Ca++, etc.), lipids (e.g. steroid, prostaglandin), peptides (e.g. insulin, ACTH), carbohydrates, glycosylated proteins (proteoglycans), nucleic acids, etc. Peptide and lipid ligands are particularly important, as most hormones belong to these classes of chemicals. Peptides are usually polar, hydrophilic molecules. As such they are unable to diffuse freely across the bi-lipid layer of the plasma membrane, so their action is mediated by a cell membrane bound receptor. On the other hand, liposoluble chemicals such as steroid hormones, can diffuse passively across the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular receptors.\\nCell signaling can occur over short or long distances, and can be further classified as autocrine, intracrine, juxtacrine, paracrine, or endocrine. Autocrine signaling occurs when the chemical signal acts on the same cell that produced the signaling chemical. Intracrine signaling occurs when the chemical signal produced by a cell acts on receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus of the same cell. Juxtacrine signaling occurs between physically adjacent cells. Paracrine signaling occurs between nearby cells. Endocrine interaction occurs between distant cells, with the chemical signal usually carried by the blood.\\nReceptors are complex proteins or tightly bound multimer of proteins, located in the plasma membrane or within the interior of the cell such as in the cytoplasm, organelles, and nucleus. Receptors have the ability to detect a signal either by binding to a specific chemical or by undergoing a conformational change when interacting with physical agents. It is the specificity of the chemical interaction between a given ligand and its receptor that confers the ability to trigger a specific cellular response. Receptors can be broadly classified into cell membrane receptors and intracellular receptors.\\nCell membrane receptors can be further classified into ion channel linked receptors, G-Protein coupled receptors and enzyme linked receptors.\\nIon channels receptors are large transmembrane proteins with a ligand activated gate function. When these receptors are activated, they may allow or block passage of specific ions across the cell membrane. Most receptors activated by physical stimuli such as pressure or temperature belongs to this category.\\nG-protein receptors are multimeric proteins embedded within the plasma membrane. These receptors have extracellular, trans-membrane and intracellular domains. The extracellular domain is responsible for the interaction with a specific ligand. The intracellular domain is responsible for the initiation of a cascade of chemical reactions which ultimately triggers the specific cellular function controlled by the receptor.\\nEnzyme-linked receptors are transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain responsible for binding a specific ligand and an intracellular domain with enzymatic or catalytic activity. Upon activation the enzymatic portion is responsible for promoting specific intracellular chemical reactions.\\nIntracellular receptors have a different mechanism of action. They usually bind to lipid soluble ligands that diffuse passively through the plasma membrane such as steroid hormones. These ligands bind to specific cytoplasmic transporters that shuttle the hormone-transporter complex inside the nucleus where specific genes are activated and the synthesis of specific proteins is promoted.\\nThe effector component of the signaling pathway begins with signal transduction. In this process, the signal, by interacting with the receptor, starts a series of molecular events within the cell leading to the final effect of the signaling process. Typically the final effect consists in the activation of an ion channel (ligand-gated ion channel) or the initiation of a second messenger system cascade that propagates the signal through the cell. Second messenger systems can amplify or modulate a signal, in which activation of a few receptors results in multiple secondary messengers being activated, thereby amplifying the initial signal (the first messenger). The downstream effects of these signaling pathways may include additional enzymatic activities such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitinylation.\\nSignaling molecules can be synthesized from various biosynthetic pathways and released through passive or active transports, or even from cell damage.\\nEach cell is programmed to respond to specific extracellular signal molecules, and is the basis of development, tissue repair, immunity, and homeostasis. Errors in signaling interactions may cause diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes.']\nCarbonylation reactions constitute a potent tool to manufacture carboxylic acids and their \nderivatives both in industry and academic organic synthesis.17 In general, the proceeding of \ncarbonylation requires the use of toxic carbon monoxide, which thus usually demands certified \nhigh pressure reaction vessels.8 Therefore, developing nongaseous CO surrogate for \nconducting safe and facileoperation carbonylation with stoichiometric amount of CO in \ncommon Pyrex glass vessels (e.g., the twochamber reactor8 and sealed glass tube) is an \nimportant and ongoing research topic in the realm of homogenous catalysis.915 Among these \nestablished CO surrogates, formic acid and its derivatives is one kind of versatile atom pubchem: [\"Name: Carbon Monoxide\\nText:\\nCarbon monoxide is a colorless, nonirritating, odorless, and tasteless gas.

It is a one-carbon compound, a gas molecular entity and a carbon oxide. It is a conjugate base of a carbon monoxide(1+).\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that has a slightly lower density than air. It is toxic to hemoglobin utilizing animals (including humans), when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also formed in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological/homeostatic functions. Carbon monoxide (CO), is a ubiquitous environmental product of organic combustion, which is also formed endogenously in the human body, as the byproduct of heme metabolism. Exhaled CO (eCO), similar to exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), has been evaluated as a candidate breath biomarker of pathophysiological states, including smoking status, and inflammatory diseases of the lung and other organs. Exhalation of corbon monoxide values have been studied as potential indicators of inflammation in asthma, stable COPD and exacerbations, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and during surgery or critical care.  A test of the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), is one of the most clinically valuable tests of lung function testing. The technique was first described  100 years ago, and applied to clinical practice many years after. The DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. The DLCO test is both convenient and simple for the patient to undergo. The ten seconds of breath-holding required for the DLCO maneuver is easier for most patients to perform than the forced exhalation required for other respiratory tests.  Carbon monoxide is presently used in small amounts in low oxygen modified atmosphere packaging systems (MAP) for fresh meat to stabilize and maintain natural meat color. This use of CO has been generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in several packaging applications for fresh meat products. Since 2002, FDA has favorably reviewed three GRAS notifications for carbon monoxide use in fresh meat packaging. The FDA classifies this drug as permitted as a food additive in the packaging and preparation of food products, while following the federal code of regulations.  There have been several concerns voiced of over the use of carbon monoxide in food products,,. The European Union has banned the use of carbon monoxide as a color stabilizer in meat and fish. A December 2001 report from the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food concluded that the gas did not pose a risk provided that food was maintained adequately cold during storage and transport to prevent the growth of microorganisms.  In New Zealand, the use of carbon monoxide in fish preparation has been banned, as it may mask the effects of food spoilage and bacterial growth.\\nCarbon Monoxide has been reported in Homo sapiens with data available.\\nCarbon Monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, poisonous gas, CO, that results from the incomplete combustion of carbon. Inhalation causes central nervous system damage and asphyxiation.\\nCARBON MONOXIDE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 6 investigational indications.\\nCarbon monoxide, with the chemical formula CO, is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is the product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing compounds, notably in internal-combustion engines. It consists of one carbon atom covalently bonded to one oxygen atom. It is a gas at room temperature. Carbon monoxide is a significantly toxic gas and is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries. Exposures can lead to significant toxicity of the central nervous system and heart. Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is heme oxygenase which is located in all cells and breaks down heme. Because it has a higher diffusion coefficient than oxygen the body easily gets rid of any CO made. When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen. Following poisoning, long-term sequelae often occur. Carbon monoxide can also have severe effects on the fetus of a pregnant woman. Despite its serious toxicity, CO is extremely useful and underpins much modern technology, being a precursor to a myriad of useful - even life-saving - products. Carbon monoxide, though thought of as a pollutant today, has always been present in the atmosphere, chiefly as a product of volcanic activity. It occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the earth's mantle. Carbon monoxide contents of volcanic gases vary from less than 0.01% to as much as 2% depending on the volcano. It also occurs naturally in bushfires. Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is extremely difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Linker was able to produce a remarkable \namount of EPOs from both anthracene13,14 and naphthalene15,16 derivatives.\nThe bicyclic 3Hisobenzofuran1one skeleton, \ncommonly known as the phthalide scaffold I, is characterized by \nthe fusion of a glactone with a benzene core (Figure 1A). A range \nof compounds bearing the phthalide structure are found within \nnatural products and are known to have significant and varied \nbiological activities.1 For example, nbutyl phthalide is marketed \nas an antiplatelet drug, with the (S)enantiomer more effective \nthan its enantiomer.2 Phthalide, and in particular its 3substituted \nderivatives, are also widely recognised as valuable starting \nmaterials in organic synthesis, and have been particularly used \nfor the synthesis of naphthalene and naphthacene natural \nproducts.1a 3Hydroxyphthalide II reversibly ringopens to \ngenerate 2formylbenzoic acid, with the cyclised form favoured in \nmost solvents.1f A range of 3hydroxyphthalides are natural \nproducts and possess significant bioactivity. pubchem: ['Name: Naphthalene\\nText:\\nNaphthalene can cause cancer according to The National Toxicology Program.\\nNaphthalene appears as a white crystalline volatile solid with a strong coal-tar odor. The solid is denser than water and insoluble in water. Burns, but may be difficult to ignite.  In the molten form it is very hot. Exposure to skin must be avoided. Also the vapors given off by the material may be toxic.  Used as a moth repellent, fumigant, lubricants, and to make other chemicals, and for many other uses\\nNaphthalene, methylnaphthalenes appears as a black liquid with the odor of coal tar. Negligibly soluble in water. Slightly denser than water. Vapors, fumes or direct contact may irritate the eyes. Direct skin contact may produce severe burns. Inhalation may produce mucous irritation, dizziness, loss of coordination, cardiovascular collapse and death.\\nNaphthalene is an aromatic hydrocarbon comprising two fused benzene rings. It occurs in the essential oils of numerous plant species e.g. magnolia. It has a role as a volatile oil component, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a carcinogenic agent, a mouse metabolite and an apoptosis inhibitor. It is an ortho-fused bicyclic arene and a member of naphthalenes.\\nNaphthalene is used in the production of phthalic anhydride; it is also used in mothballs. Acute (short- term) exposure of humans to naphthalene by inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact is associated with hemolytic anemia, damage to the liver, and neurological damage. Cataracts have also been reported in workers acutely exposed to naphthalene by inhalation and ingestion. Chronic (long-term) exposure of workers and rodents to naphthalene has been reported to cause cataracts and damage to the retina. Hemolytic anemia has been reported in infants born to mothers who \"sniffed\" and ingested naphthalene (as mothballs) during pregnancy. Available data are inadequate to establish a causal relationship between exposure to naphthalene and cancer in humans. EPA has classified naphthalene as a Group C, possible human carcinogen.\\nNaphthalene has been reported in Herbertus norenus, Swertia japonica, and other organisms with data available.\\nNaphthalene is a white, volatile, solid polycyclic hydrocarbon with a strong mothball odor. Naphthalene is obtained from either coal tar or petroleum distillation and is primarily used to manufacture phthalic anhydride, but is also used in moth repellents. Exposure to naphthalene is associated with hemolytic anemia, damage to the liver and neurological system, cataracts and retinal hemorrhage. Naphthalene is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen and may be associated with an increased risk of developing laryngeal and colorectal cancer. (NCI05)\\nNAPHTHALENE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of I and has 1 investigational indication.\\nNaphthalene is the simplest polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of two fused benzene rings. It has a distinct, pungent odor that can be detected at levels as low as 0.08 ppm.  Naphthalene is the most abundant single component of coal tar so most of it is now industrially derived from coal tar. From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during petroleum refining, but today petroleum-derived naphthalene represents only a minor component of naphthalene production. Naphthalene is also produced naturally with trace amounts of naphthalene being produced by black walnuts, magnolias and specific types of deer, as well as the Formosan subterranean termite. Some strains of the endophytic fungus (Muscodor albus) also produce naphthalene. Naphthalene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are released from incomplete combustion processes originating in industry, cigarette smoke and motor vehicle exhaust, as well as natural events such as forest fires. Industrially, naphthalene is used in the production of phthalic anhydride, as a solvent for chemical reactions, as a wetting agent and as a fumigant.  It is also used in pyrotechnic special effects such as the generation of black smoke and simulated explosions. In the past, naphthalene was administered orally to kill parasitic worms in livestock. Naphthalene was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, though its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels that are toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths. Naphthalene has been shown to exhibit apoptotic and catabolic functions (4, 5). Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy red blood cells. Humans, in particular children, have developed this condition, known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene.\\nnaphthalene is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nSee also: (1,2,3,4-~13~C_4_)Naphthalene (annotation moved to) ...

Fluorine is a naturally-occurring, pale yellow-green gas with a sharp odor. It combines with metals to make fluorides such as sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride, both white solids. Sodium fluoride dissolves easily in water, but calcium fluoride does not. Fluorine also combines with hydrogen to make hydrogen fluoride, a colorless gas. Hydrogen fluoride dissolves in water to form hydrofluoric acid. Fluorine and hydrogen fluoride are used to make certain chemical compounds. Hydrofluoric acid is used for etching glass. Other fluoride compounds are used in making steel, chemicals, ceramics, lubricants, dyes, plastics, and pesticides. Fluorides are often added to drinking water supplies and to a variety of dental products, including toothpaste and mouth rinses, to prevent dental cavities. UPDATE: In 2015, thePHS replacedthe 1962 Drinking Water Standards from 0.7\"\"1.2 mg/L to an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L. This is to provide optimal concentration of fluoride in drinking water that provides the best balance of protection from dental caries while limiting the risk of dental fluorosis.\\nFluorine is a pale yellow gas with a pungent odor. It is commonly shipped as a cryogenic liquid. It is toxic by inhalation and skin absorption. Contact with skin in lower than lethal concentrations causes chemical burns.

It is the lightest halogen and exists at standard conditions as pale yellow diatomic gas. Fluorine is extremely reactive as it reacts with all other elements except for the light noble gases. It is highly toxic.\\nAmong the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in cosmic abundance and 13th in crustal abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II.\\nOwing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminium refining. The carbon–fluorine bond is usually very stable. Organofluorine compounds are widely used as refrigerants, electrical insulation, and PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C−F bonds. The fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.\\nFluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 23,500 times that of carbon dioxide, and SF6 has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. Organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants and marine sponges synthesize organofluorine poisons (most often monofluoroacetates) that help deter predation.\"]\nto the CF Bond. Chem.

Pure nickel is a hard, silvery-white metal. Nickel can be combined with other metals, such as iron, copper, chromium, and zinc, to form alloys. These alloys are used to make coins, jewelry, and items such as valves and heat exchangers. Most nickel is used to make stainless steel. Nickel can combine with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, and oxygen to form nickel compounds. Many nickel compounds dissolve fairly easy in water and have a green color. Nickel compounds are used for nickel plating, to color ceramics, to make some batteries, and as substances known as catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions. Nickel is found in all soil and is emitted from volcanoes. Nickel is also found in meteorites and on the ocean floor.

Nickel is an essential element in some animal species, and it has been suggested it may be essential for human nutrition. Nickel dermatitis, consisting of itching of the fingers, hands, and forearms, is the most common effect in humans from chronic (long-term) skin contact with nickel. Respiratory effects have also been reported in humans from inhalation exposure to nickel. Human and animal studies have reported an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers from exposure to nickel refinery dusts and nickel subsulfide. Animal studies of soluble nickel compounds (i.e., nickel carbonyl) have reported lung tumors.

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.\\nAlthough most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include Sulawesi, Indonesia, the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.\\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.\\nAbout 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\"]\nModern organonickel chemistry has significantly contributed to \nthis area with the emergence of new and highly efficient radical \npathways to forge C(acyl)C(sp3) bonds under very mild \nconditions.3 Nickelcatalyzed reductive coupling reactions of \nacyltransfer reagents (typically acyl halides, anhydrides, and \n(thio)esters) with C(sp3) electrophiles including alkyl halides, \nalkyl carboxylic acidderived redox active esters, and Katritzky \nreagents, have been recently highlighted as very powerful \nstrategies to achieve this goal.4 By coupling two reactive, yet \nhighly accessible and benchstable electrophiles, they provide a \npractical and versatile access to a variety of dialkyl ketones with \nunique functional group tolerance.5 However, the excess \namounts of heterogeneous metal reductants that are typically \nused to generate a reactive alkyl radical and sustain the nickel \ncatalytic redox cycle inevitably thwarts potential largescale \napplications. wikipedia: ['The haloalkanes (also known as halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are alkanes containing one or more halogen substituents. They are a subset of the general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially. They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes that contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter. For more information, see Halomethane. Haloalkane or alkyl halides are the compounds which have the general formula \"RX\" where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).\\nHaloalkanes have been known for centuries. Chloroethane was produced in the 15th century. The systematic synthesis of such compounds developed in the 19th century in step with the development of organic chemistry and the understanding of the structure of alkanes. Methods were developed for the selective formation of C-halogen bonds. Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups.\\nWhile many haloalkanes are human-produced, substantial amounts are biogenic.']\nModern organonickel chemistry has significantly contributed to \nthis area with the emergence of new and highly efficient radical \npathways to forge C(acyl)C(sp3) bonds under very mild \nconditions.3 Nickelcatalyzed reductive coupling reactions of \nacyltransfer reagents (typically acyl halides, anhydrides, and \n(thio)esters) with C(sp3) electrophiles including alkyl halides, \nalkyl carboxylic acidderived redox active esters, and Katritzky \nreagents, have been recently highlighted as very powerful \nstrategies to achieve this goal.4 By coupling two reactive, yet \nhighly accessible and benchstable electrophiles, they provide a \npractical and versatile access to a variety of dialkyl ketones with \nunique functional group tolerance.5 However, the excess \namounts of heterogeneous metal reductants that are typically \nused to generate a reactive alkyl radical and sustain the nickel \ncatalytic redox cycle inevitably thwarts potential largescale \napplications.", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Acyl halides and alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "acyl halide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "acyl halides and alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "acyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "acyl-transfer reagents and C(sp3) electrophiles", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

LLZO has a high ionic conductivity and thermal and chemical stability against reactions with prospective electrode materials, mainly lithium metal, giving it an advantage for use as an electrolyte in solid-state batteries. LLZO exhibits favorable characteristics, including the accessibility of starting materials, cost-effectiveness, and straightforward preparation and densification processes. These attributes position this zirconium-containing lithium garnet as a promising solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.\\nMoreover, LLZO demonstrates a notable total conductivity, surpassing most other solid lithium-ion conductors and many lithium garnets. The fact that the total and bulk conductivities are of the same order of magnitude distinguishes LLZO garnet-type oxide as particularly attractive when compared to other ceramic lithium-ion conductors. This suggests that LLZO, with its garnet-like structure, holds significant promise for enhancing the performance of solid-state lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.\\n\\nSince oxygen, zirconium, and lanthanum in LLZO are rigidly bound in the framework of the garnet-like structure, their mobility will be negligible at operating temperatures and, hence, the ionic motion is due to the transport of Li+ ions.\\nThe enhanced lithium ion conductivity and reduced activation energy observed in LLZO, compared to other lithium-containing garnets, can be attributed to several factors. These include an expansion in the cubic lattice constant, an increase in lithium ion concentration, reduced chemical interactions between Li+ ions and other lattice ions, and improved densification. Even when compared to the conductivity of the relatively unstable polycrystalline Li3N at lower temperatures, LLZO demonstrates comparable performance. However, at elevated temperatures, LLZO outperforms Li3N, exhibiting a higher total conductivity.\\nLLZO  has two stable phases: the tetragonal phase and the cubic (Cubic crystal system) phase. Although the tetragonal phase can be obtained at lower synthesis temperatures than the cubic phase, the latter has higher conductivity than the former. Both phases possess the same structural framework but there is a difference in the distribution of Li atoms, which dominantly determines the ionic conductivity of LLZO,  Li ions have more available sites for migration in the cubic phase than in the tetragonal phase.

Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek.

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)82 (BTT3 1,3,5benzenetristetrazolate)12 MOF", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)8", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)82 (BTT3 1,3,5benzenetristetrazolate)12 MOF", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)82", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)82", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)82", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Aluminum is used for beverage cans, pots and pans, airplanes, siding and roofing, and foil. Aluminum is often mixed with small amounts of other metals to form aluminum alloys, which are stronger and harder. Aluminum compounds have many different uses, for example, as alums in water-treatment and alumina in abrasives and furnace linings.

It has a density lower than that of other common metals, about one-third that of steel. Aluminium has a great affinity towards oxygen, forming a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. It visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, nonmagnetic, and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al, which is highly abundant, making aluminium the 12th-most abundant element in the universe. The radioactivity of 26Al leads to it being used in radiometric dating.\\nChemically, aluminium is a post-transition metal in the boron group; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The aluminium cation Al3+ is small and highly charged; as such, it has more polarizing power, and bonds formed by aluminium have a more covalent character. The strong affinity of aluminium for oxygen leads to the common occurrence of its oxides in nature. Aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third-most abundant element, after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal. It is obtained industrially by mining bauxite, a sedimentary rock rich in aluminium minerals.\\nThe discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the public with the Hall–Héroult process developed independently by French engineer Paul Héroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In the First and Second World Wars, aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced non-ferrous metal, surpassing copper. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.\\nDespite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to metabolize aluminium salts, but this aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of the abundance of these salts, the potential for a biological role for them is of interest, and studies are ongoing.']\nLithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the standard lithium salt for the stateoftheart \ncommercial lithium ion batteries (LIBs).

Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years.

It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']\n.

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.\\nAlthough most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include Sulawesi, Indonesia, the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.\\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.\\nAbout 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy.

Copper is an essential element in plants and animals (including humans), which means it is necessary for us to live. Therefore, plants and animals must absorb some copper from eating, drinking, and breathing. Copper is used to make many different kinds of products like wire, plumbing pipes, and sheet metal. U.S. pennies made before 1982 are made of copper, while those made after 1982 are only coated with copper. Copper is also combined with other metals to make brass and bronze pipes and faucets.

The IMA symbol is Cu.\\nCopper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.\\nA heavy metal trace element with the atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.55.\\nSee also: Copper Gluconate (active moiety of); Copper Naphthenate (active moiety of); Cupric sulfate, basic copper sulfate dibasic (active moiety of) ...

As a result, breath CH4 excretion can be used as an indicator of the in situ activity of the methanogenic flora. All CH4 produced in human beings is a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria, and about 50% of CH4 produced in the gut is absorbed and excreted in expired air. Because there appears to be no catabolism of this gas by other colonic organisms or host cells, breath CH4 measurements provide a rapid, simple means of semi quantitatively assessing the ongoing in situ metabolism of the methanogenic flora. It could seem likely that the intracolonic activity of a variety of bacteria similarly might be assessed quantitatively via analysis of expired air. However, the application of this methodology has been confounded by the rapid catabolism of many volatile bacterial products by other bacteria or human tissue. A striking aspect of the studies of breath CH4 measurements is the enormous individual variations in the excretion of this gas. Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult population do not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4. The remaining 34% of the adult population has appreciable breath methane concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm). On this basis the population can be divided into CH4 producers or nonproducers, although a more accurate term would be to define subjects as being low or high CH4 producers. The primary methanogen present in the human colon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, produces methane via a reaction that relies entirely on H2 produced by other organisms to reduce CO2 to CH4. Thus, breath CH4 concentrations might be expected to mirror breath H2 concentrations; however, the high levels of CH4 observed in the fasting state may result from H2 derived from endogenous rather than dietary substrates. A diverse assortment of conditions has been associated with a high prevalence of methane producers including diverticulosis, cystic fibrosis, high fasting serum cholesterol levels, encopresis in children, and aorto-iliac vascular disease, whereas obesity (measured as skin-fold thickness) was related inversely to methane production. The challenge that remains is to determine to what extent methanogens actively influence body physiology vs. simply serve as passive indicators of colonic function.

Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium Dioxide Microcapsules", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TiO2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "double emulsion capsules", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TiO2 microcapsules", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium Dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium Dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium Dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide microcapsules", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Microcapsules", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium Dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "double emulsion capsules", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Sodium becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure, and at even higher pressures it is expected to become a metal again.\\nWhen discussing the periodic table and some chemical properties the term metal is often used to denote those elements which in pure form and at standard conditions are metals in the sense of electrical conduction mentioned above.  The related term metallic may also be used for types of dopant atoms or alloying elements.\\nIn astronomy metal refers to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium. In this sense the first four \"metals\" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. The metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.\\nThe strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks. Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements. There is also extensive use of multi-element metals such as titanium nitride or degenerate semiconductors in the semiconductor industry.\\nThe history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago. Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the fifth millennium BCE. Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the discovery of sodium—the first light metal—in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "chalcogenides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chalcogenides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

As a thermoplastic polyester (or polyhydroxyalkanoate) it has the backbone formula (C3H4O2)n or [–C(CH3)HC(=O)O–]n. PLA is formally obtained by condensation of lactic acid C(CH3)(OH)HCOOH with loss of water (hence its name). It can also be prepared by ring-opening polymerization of lactide [–C(CH3)HC(=O)O–]2, the cyclic dimer of the basic repeating unit. Often PLA is blended with other polymers. PLA can be biodegradable or long-lasting, depending on the manufacturing process, additives and copolymers.\\nPLA has become a popular material due to it being economically produced from renewable resources and the possibility to use it for compostable products. In 2022, PLA had the highest consumption volume of any bioplastic of the world, with a share of ca. 26 % of total bioplastic demand. Although its production is growing, PLA is still not as important as traditional commodity polymers like PET or PVC. Its widespread application has been hindered by numerous physical and processing shortcomings. PLA is the most widely used plastic filament material in FDM 3D printing, due to its low melting point, high strength, low thermal expansion, and good layer adhesion, although it possesses poor heat resistance unless annealed.\\nAlthough the name \"polylactic acid\" is widely used, it does not comply with IUPAC standard nomenclature, which is \"poly(lactic acid)\".

It is not among the essential amino acids. Glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serves as metabolic fuel or other functional roles in the body. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: * Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. * Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization.\\nA non-essential amino acid naturally occurring in the L-form.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

These reagents are important in organic synthesis, and are frequently used to transfer the organic group or the lithium atom to the substrates in synthetic steps, through nucleophilic addition or simple deprotonation. Organolithium reagents are used in industry as an initiator for anionic polymerization, which leads to the production of various elastomers. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry. Due to the large difference in electronegativity between the carbon atom and the lithium atom, the C−Li bond is highly ionic.

Sodium chloride is the primary salt in seawater and in the extracellular fluid of many multicellular organisms. It is listed on the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines.\\nSodium Chloride is a metal halide composed of sodium and chloride with sodium and chloride replacement capabilities.

Salt in its natural form is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in vast quantities in the ocean, which has about 35 grams of sodium chloride per litre, corresponding to a salinity of 3.5%. Salt is essential for animal life, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous of food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation. Salt is produced from salt mines or by the evaporation of seawater or mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Salt is used in many industrial processes and in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other consumer products. Of the global annual production of around 200,000,000 tonnes of salt, only 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning, highway de-icing and various agricultural applications. For humans, salt is a major source of sodium.

When used in food, especially in granulated form, it is more formally called table salt. In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. Salt is essential for life in general (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food, including otherwise unpalatable food. Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.\\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. For example, the El Paso Salt War which took place in El Paso in the late 1860.  Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.\\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a feedstock for the production of chemicals. It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine, and in the manufacture of products such as polyvinyl chloride, plastics, and paper pulp. Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes, only a small percentage is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use.Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt, the latter of which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\\nSodium is an essential element for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. However, excessive salt consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt, per day.']\nto produce valueadded commodity \nchemicals.2 Thus, CO2 is an ideal C1 building block for organic synthesis because it is \ninexpensive and abundant and can be considered a waste product.3 \n\nOne of those valueadded products obtained from CO2 is cyclic carbonates, which can be \nused industrially as a polar aprotic solvent,4 as an electrolyte for lithiumion batteries,5 \nand as intermediates in the manufacture of fine chemicals6 and polymers.7 Cyclic \ncarbonates are mostly produced by the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides in the presence \nof a wide range of catalysts,8 including hydrogenbond catalysts,9 ionic liquids,10 \nquaternary ammonium salt,11 organic polymers,12 MOFs,13 porous materials,14 layered \ndouble hydroxide (LDH)15 and metalbased catalysts.16 \n\nConsidering that the use of mild reaction conditions remains the principal challenge, \nwe propose the use of mixed metal oxides (MMOs) as catalysts in cycloaddition reactions, with \nthe objective of being able to carry out the catalytic process under atmospheric CO2 pressure \nand moderate temperature.17 \n\nScheme 1. wikipedia: [\"In organic chemistry, a carbonate ester (organic carbonate or organocarbonate) is an ester of carbonic acid.

The others are adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, uracil binds to adenine via two hydrogen bonds. In DNA, the uracil nucleobase is replaced by thymine (T). Uracil is a demethylated form of thymine.\\nUracil is a common and naturally occurring pyrimidine derivative. The name \"uracil\" was coined in 1885 by the German chemist Robert Behrend, who was attempting to synthesize derivatives of uric acid. Originally discovered in 1900 by Alberto Ascoli, it was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein; it was also found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. It is a planar, unsaturated compound that has the ability to absorb light.\\nUracil that was formed extraterrestrially has been detected in the Murchison meteorite, in near-Earth asteroid Ryugu, and possibly on the surface of the moon Titan. It has been synthesized under cold laboratory conditions similar to outer space, from pyrimidine embedded in water ice and exposed to ultraviolet light.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-Hydroxypropionic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

The etymology stems from Latin ligare, which means 'to bind'. In protein-ligand binding, the ligand is usually a molecule which produces a signal by binding to a site on a target protein.  The binding typically results in a change of conformational isomerism (conformation) of the target protein. In DNA-ligand binding studies, the ligand can be a small molecule, ion, or protein which binds to the DNA double helix.  The relationship between ligand and binding partner is a function of charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular structure.\\nBinding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces. The association or docking is actually reversible through dissociation. Measurably irreversible covalent bonding between a ligand and target molecule is atypical in biological systems. In contrast to the definition of ligand in metalorganic and inorganic chemistry, in biochemistry it is ambiguous whether the ligand generally binds at a metal site, as is the case in hemoglobin.  In general, the interpretation of ligand is contextual with regards to what sort of binding has been observed.\\nLigand binding to a receptor protein alters the conformation by affecting the three-dimensional shape orientation. The conformation of a receptor protein composes the functional state. Ligands include substrates, inhibitors, activators, signaling lipids, and neurotransmitters. The rate of binding is called affinity, and this measurement typifies a tendency or strength of the effect. Binding affinity is actualized not only by host–guest interactions, but also by solvent effects that can play a dominant, steric role which drives non-covalent binding in solution.  The solvent provides a chemical environment for the ligand and receptor to adapt, and thus accept or reject each other as partners.\\nRadioligands are radioisotope labeled compounds used in vivo as tracers in PET studies and for in vitro binding studies.\"]\nTo address \nthese challenges, the utilization of bioorthogonal chemistry to \nregulate selfimmolation presents a promising venue for precise \ncontrol of cargo release.3639 \nBioorthogonal chemistry refers to highly specific chemical \nreactions that can occur inside living systems without interfer\ning with native biochemical processes and has been coupled \nwith controlled release systems.40 Noncovalent chemistry is \nemerging as an alternative approach to covalency for forming \nunnatural complexes in living systems for applications such as \ncell labeling.41 Besides its potential for reversibility, noncova\nlent chemistry benefits from not being dependent on second\norder rate constants or highly activated reagents, which are ma\njor challenges present in developing bioorthogonal reactions.42 \nInstead, the emphasis is on achieving high binding affinities \n(Ka).42 A group of synthetic pumpkinshaped macrocyclic mol\necules known as cucurbitnurils (n  58, 10, 1315) have at\ntracted increasing attention in medicinal chemistry and biomed\nical applications due to their high affinity4346 and highly selec\ntive binding interactions which typically do not interfere with \nbiological systems.4749 These characteristics have rendered cu\ncurbitmediated hostguest chemistry promising for a range of \nbiological applications, such as proteins and biomolecule label\ning,5052 cellular and animal imaging,5357 modulating dynamic \nDNA chemistry,58,59 and protein aggregation,60,61 controlling \nbioorthogonal catalysis,62 and protein separation.63 \nOf particular interests are cucurbitnurilmediated supramo\nlecular drug delivery systems encapsulating physically en\ntrapped therapeutic agents.64 A popular strategy involves encap\nsulating engineered small molecule drugs in the cucurbitnuril \ncavity through noncovalent hostguest interactions to down\nregulate their bioactivity,65 while introducing a competitive \nguest molecule with a higher binding affinity enables the on\ndemand release of the caged therapeutic molecule and activa\ntion of its therapeutic effects.6670 Moreover, cucurbitnuril\nbased chemistry has been innovatively used to construct self\nassembling DNAsmall molecule chimeras,71 nanomateri\nals,72,73 and hydrogel networks74 for the delivery of therapeutics.\n34 \n\nNanoscale drug delivery systems offer greater therapeutic efficacy for many diseases, \n35 \nparticularly cancer treatment, due to numerous advantages Nanoscale particle size, the ability \n36 \nto deliver the drug molecules to the target tissue at the desired dose, the ability to release the \n37 \ndrug in the target tissue for the desired time, and thus reduce the systemic side effects of drugs. 38 \nFor these reasons, they represent the most promising treatment approach.

Drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.\\nDrugs are classified in many ways. One of the key divisions is by level of control, which distinguishes prescription drugs (those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the medical prescription) from over-the-counter drugs (those that consumers can order for themselves). Medicines may be classified by mode of action, route of administration, biological system affected, or therapeutic effects. The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines.\\nDrug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists, and governments. As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines.

Double- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes are special cases of MWCNT.\\nCarbon nanotubes can exhibit remarkable properties, such as exceptional tensile strength and thermal conductivity because of their nanostructure and strength of the bonds between carbon atoms. Some SWCNT structures exhibit high electrical conductivity while others are semiconductors. In addition, carbon nanotubes can be chemically modified. These properties are expected to be valuable in many areas of technology, such as electronics, optics, composite materials (replacing or complementing carbon fibres), nanotechnology (including nanomedicine), and other applications of materials science.\\nThe predicted properties for SWCNTs were tantalising, but a path to synthesising them was lacking until 1993, when Iijima and Ichihashi at NEC, and Bethune and others at IBM independently discovered that co-vaporising carbon and transition metals such as iron and cobalt could specifically catalyse SWCNT formation.

Connolly at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington Delaware (U.S. Patent 3,282,875). Additional work on the polymer family was performed in the late 1960s by Dr. Walther Grot of DuPont. Nafion is a brand of the Chemours company. It is the first of a class of synthetic polymers with ionic properties that are called ionomers. Nafion\\'s unique ionic properties are a result of incorporating perfluorovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate groups onto a tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone.  Nafion has received a considerable amount of attention as a proton conductor for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of its excellent chemical and mechanical stability in the harsh conditions of this application.\\nThe chemical basis of Nafion\\'s ion-conductive properties remain a focus of extensive research. Ion conductivity of Nafion increases with the level of hydration. Exposure of Nafion to a humidified environment or liquid water increases the amount of water molecules associated with each sulfonic acid group. The hydrophilic nature of the ionic groups attract water molecules, which begin to solvate the ionic groups and dissociate the protons from the -SO3H (sulfonic acid) group. The dissociated protons \"hop\" from one acid site to another through mechanisms facilitated by the water molecules and hydrogen bonding. Upon hydration, Nafion phase-separates at nanometer length scales resulting in formation of an interconnected network of hydrophilic domains which allow movement of water and cations, but the membranes do not conduct electrons and minimally conduct anions due to permselectivity (charge-based exclusion). Nafion can be manufactured with or exchanged to alternate cation forms for different applications (e.g. lithiated for Li-ion batteries) and at different equivalent weights (EWs), alternatively considered as ion-exchange capacities (IECs), to achieve a range of cationic conductivities with trade-offs to other physicochemical properties such as water uptake and swelling.']\nFurther disad\nvantages are formation of potentially rate limiting solid\nelectrolyte interphases, simultaneous anion diusion8,\nlower operating voltages9, and dendrite formation caus\ning incompatibility with Limetal anodes with 10\nthe capacity of current graphitic anodes10).11 The use of\na solidstate electrolyte (SSE) is therefore desirable as it\nxes many of these problems simultaneously.

Fast ion conductors are used primarily in solid oxide fuel cells. As solid electrolytes they allow the movement of ions without the need for a liquid or soft membrane separating the electrodes.

PFAS came into use with the invention of Teflon in 1938 to make fluoropolymer coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease, and water. They are now used in products including waterproof fabric such as Nylon, yoga pants, carpets, shampoo, feminine hygiene products, mobile phone screens, wall paint, furniture, adhesives, food packaging, heat-resistant non-stick cooking surfaces such as Teflon, firefighting foam, and the insulation of electrical wire. PFAS are also used by the cosmetic industry in most cosmetics and personal care products, including lipstick, eye liner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, and nail polish.\\nMany PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA pose health and environmental concerns because they are persistent organic pollutants; they were branded as \"forever chemicals\" in an article in The Washington Post in 2018. Some have half-lives of over eight years due to a carbon-fluorine bond, one of the strongest in organic chemistry. They move through soils and bioaccumulate in fish and wildlife, which are then eaten by humans. Residues are now commonly found in rain, drinking water, and wastewater. Since PFAS compounds are highly mobile, they are readily absorbed through human skin and through tear ducts, and such products on lips are often unwittingly ingested. Due to the large number of PFAS, it is challenging to study and assess the potential human health and environmental risks; more research is necessary and is ongoing.\\nExposure to PFAS, some of which have been classified as carcinogenic and/or as endocrine disruptors, has been linked to cancers such as kidney, prostate and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, suboptimal antibody response / decreased immunity, decreased fertility, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, reduced infant and fetal growth and developmental issues in children, obesity, dyslipidemia (abnormally high cholesterol), and higher rates of hormone interference.\\nThe use of PFAS has been regulated internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants since 2009, with some jurisdictions, such as China and the European Union, planning further reductions and phase-outs. However, major producers and users such as the United States, Israel, and Malaysia have not ratified the agreement and the chemical industry has lobbied governments to reduce regulations or have moved production to countries such as Thailand, where there is less regulation.\\nThe market for PFAS was estimated to be US$28 billion in 2023 and the majority are produced by 12 companies: 3M, AGC Inc., Archroma, Arkema, BASF, Bayer, Chemours, Daikin, Honeywell, Merck Group, Shandong Dongyue Chemical, and Solvay. Sales of PFAS, which cost approximately $20 per kilogram, generate a total industry profit of $4 billion per year on 16% profit margins. Due to health concerns, several companies have ended or plan to end the sale of PFAS or products that contain them; these include W. L. Gore & Associates (the maker of Gore-Tex), H&M, Patagonia, REI, and 3M. PFAS producers have paid billions of dollars to settle litigation claims, the largest being a $10.3 billion settlement paid by 3M for water contamination in 2023. Studies have shown that companies have known of the health dangers since the 1970s – DuPont and 3M were aware that PFAS was \"highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested\". External costs, including those associated with remediation of PFAS from soil and water contamination, treatment of related diseases, and monitoring of PFAS pollution, may be as high as US$17.5 trillion annually, according to ChemSec. The Nordic Council of Ministers estimated health costs to be at least €52–84 billion in the European Economic Area. In the United States, PFAS-attributable disease costs are estimated to be $6–62 billion.\\nIn January 2025, reports stated that the cost of cleaning up toxic PFAS pollution in the UK and Europe could exceed £1.6 trillion over the next 20 years, averaging £84 billion annually.']\nAs a subgroup of solidstate nanopores, the glass \nnanopipette is modeled as a costeffective and versatile source of conical shaped \nnanopore and has been used for single DNA, protein, and nanoparticle (NP) analysis.18\n22 Compared with other solidstate nanopores, the advantages of the nanopipette are \nobvious, for it can be facilely obtained from pulling the glass or quartz capillaries with \norifice diameters ranging from micrometers to nanometers.18, 23, 24 Owing to the unique \ntip nanoarchitecture, the nanopipette is envisioned as a powerful means for integrated \nstudy and manipulation of chemical and biological sensing and electrophysiological \napplications.2527 Herein, the glass nanopipette tip structure was reconstructed through \nuptodown approach by filled the very tip of the glass nanopipette with mesoporous \ncarbon, which was subdivided and formed differential structure. pubchem: ['Name: Silicon Dioxide\\nText:\\nSilica is another name for the chemical compound composed of silicon and oxygen with the chemical formula SiO2, or silicon dioxide.

The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2.

Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, behind feldspar.\\nQuartz exists in two forms, the normal α-quartz and the high-temperature β-quartz, both of which are chiral.

It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. Dopamine constitutes about 80% of the catecholamine content in the brain. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. Neurotransmitters are synthesized in specific regions of the brain but affect many regions systemically. The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain, and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.\\nIn popular culture and media, dopamine is often portrayed as the main chemical of pleasure, but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience; in other words, dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence (i.e., the desirability or aversiveness) of an outcome, which in turn propels the organism's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome.\\nOutside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger. In blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator; in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.\\nSeveral important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured; Levodopa, a pure form of L-DOPA, is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity. Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents. Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with decreased dopamine activity. Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection. It is useful in the treatment of severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock. In newborn babies it may be used for hypotension and septic shock.\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine-derived cyclically conjugated compound", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Benzene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Benzene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Tetrahydroisoquinoline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']\nIn recent years, monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) have garnered considerable attention amid other twodimensional\n(2D) materials due to their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical\nproperties 16.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']\nSyngas (COH2) serves as a crucial platform for transforming the nonpetroleum carbon \nresources, such as coal, natural gas, shale gas and biomass, into liquid fuels and basic chemicals. 13 In that context, major efforts have focused on the direct conversion of syngas into ethanol, \nan ideal fuel additive, promising hydrogen carrier, and versatile buildingblock in chemical \nsynthesis.48 Among potential candidates, Rhbased catalysts show promising ethanol \nselectivity in syngas conversion in the presence of specific additives, socalled promoters.912 \nAmong them, Fe has been shown to be particularly efficient to trigger ethanol production of \nRhbased catalysts.9, 1317 However, the promotional effect of Fe under syngas conversion \nconditions remains poorly understood, partly because of the illdefined catalyst structures \nresulting from conventional synthetic approaches. wikipedia: ['Syngas, or synthesis gas, is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in various ratios.

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Syngas (COH2)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ethanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Syngas", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Syngas", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Syngas", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ethanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Syngas", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Syngas", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Syngas", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']\nIn turn, sodium ion chemistries such as Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) hard carbon (HC) and \nPrussian blue analogs (PBA) hard carbon offer highpower capabilities making them more attractive \nand cheaper alternatives for highpower applications610 such as hybrid grid storage, power tools, fast \n(dis)charging electromotive, military equipment, etc. In this context, our group in collaboration with the Naion battery startup TIAMAT Energy \n(France) is actively working to develop highpower NVPF  HC based Naion cells.

The free metal does not occur in nature and must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite, and halite (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.\\nSodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide (lye) is used in soap manufacture, and sodium chloride (edible salt) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.\\nSodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure. Animal cells actively pump sodium ions out of the cells by means of the sodium–potassium pump, an enzyme complex embedded in the cell membrane, in order to maintain a roughly ten-times higher concentration of sodium ions outside the cell than inside.

Nearly all of the world's current supply of hydrogen is created from fossil fuels. Most hydrogen is gray hydrogen made through steam methane reforming. In this process, hydrogen is produced from a chemical reaction between steam and methane, the main component of natural gas. Producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits 6.6–9.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide. When carbon capture and storage is used to remove a large fraction of these emissions, the product is known as blue hydrogen.\\nGreen hydrogen is usually understood to be produced from renewable electricity via electrolysis of water. Less frequently, definitions of green hydrogen  include hydrogen produced from other low-emission sources such as biomass. Producing green hydrogen is currently more expensive than producing gray hydrogen, and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low. Other methods of hydrogen production include biomass gasification, methane pyrolysis, and extraction of underground hydrogen.\\nAs of 2023, less than 1% of dedicated hydrogen production is low-carbon, i.e. blue hydrogen, green hydrogen, and hydrogen produced from biomass.\\nIn 2020, roughly 87 million tons of hydrogen was produced worldwide for various uses, such as oil refining, in the production of ammonia through the Haber process, and in the production of methanol through reduction of carbon monoxide. The global hydrogen generation market was fairly valued at US$155 billion in 2022, and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.\"]\nIn order to avoid or limit\nthe utilization of fossil fuels, recently, many researchers have proposed more strategies to produce clean fuels\nsuch as hydrogen (H2), Ammonia (NH3), hydrous hydrazine, Metalion batteries from diverse sources using\nnanosized materials.

They are coupled with G proteins. They pass through the cell membrane seven times in the form of six loops (three extracellular loops interacting with ligand molecules, three intracellular loops interacting with G proteins, an N-terminal extracellular region and a C-terminal intracellular region) of amino acid residues, which is why they are sometimes referred to as seven-transmembrane receptors. Ligands can bind either to the extracellular N-terminus and loops (e.g. glutamate receptors) or to the binding site within transmembrane helices (rhodopsin-like family). They are all activated by agonists, although a spontaneous auto-activation of an empty receptor has also been observed. \\nG protein-coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, and choanoflagellates. The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters. They vary in size from small molecules to peptides, to large proteins. G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases.\\nThere are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-coupled receptors:\\n\\nthe cAMP signal pathway and\\nthe phosphatidylinositol signal pathway.\\nWhen a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change in the GPCR, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated G protein by exchanging the GDP bound to the G protein for a GTP. The G protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gα12/13).:\\u200a1160\\u200a\\nGPCRs are an important drug target and approximately 34% of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs target 108 members of this family.

Its biological function is complex, touching on diverse functions including mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction.\\nSerotonin is produced in the central nervous system (CNS), specifically in the brainstem's raphe nuclei, the skin's Merkel cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and the tongue's taste receptor cells. Approximately 90% of the serotonin the human body produces is in the gastrointestinal tract's enterochromaffin cells, where it regulates intestinal movements. Additionally, it is stored in blood platelets and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction, where it then acts as an agonist to other platelets. About 8% is found in platelets and 1–2% in the CNS.\\nThe serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally, which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation, which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility. The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS, where it has various functions, including the regulation of mood, appetite, and sleep.\\nSerotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, which can serve as a vasoconstrictor or a vasodilator while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II and norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium – such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In normal physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells and the inhibition of the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.\\nBiochemically, the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan. Serotonin is metabolized mainly to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), chiefly by the liver.\\nSeveral classes of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), interfere with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal, therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the synapses.\\nBesides mammals, serotonin is found in all bilateral animals including worms and insects, as well as in fungi and in plants. Serotonin's presence in insect venoms and plant spines serves to cause pain, which is a side-effect of serotonin injection. Serotonin is produced by pathogenic amoebae, causing diarrhea in the human gut. Its widespread presence in many seeds and fruits may serve to stimulate the digestive tract into expelling the seeds.\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5HT7Rs (Serotonin 7 receptor)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT1R", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT2Rs", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5HT2A receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT1A receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5HT receptors", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT receptors", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.

It is also known as methanal, methylene oxide, oxymethyline, methylaldehyde, and oxomethane. Formaldehyde is naturally produced in small amounts in our bodies. It is used in the production of fertilizer, paper, plywood, and urea-formaldehyde resins. It is also used as a preservative in some foods and in many products used around the house, such as antiseptics, medicines, and cosmetics.\\nFormaldehyde (gas) can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\\nSolids containing varying amounts of formaldehyde, probably as paraformaldehyde (polymers of formula HO(CH2O)xH where x averages about 30). A hazard to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit spread to the environment.\\nFormaldehyde, solution, flammable appears as a colorless aqueous solution of formaldehyde, which is a gas at ordinary conditions. Has a pungent irritating odor. Flash point varies from 122 to 141 °F. Denser than water. The vapors are heavier than air and are highly irritating to the nose. Toxic if swallowed. Contact can cause severe injury to the skin accompanied by drying, cracking, and scaling. Used to make plastics, other chemicals, and fertilizers. Used as a preservative and a corrosion inhibitor.   Rate of onset: Immediate  Persistence: Hours  Odor threshold: 1 ppm  Source/use/other hazard: Disinfection/germicide; fungicide; textile; health care (tissue fixing).\\nFormaldehyde, solutions (formalin) (corrosive) appears as a colorless liquid with a pungent irritating odor. Contains 37-50% formaldehyde by mass and varying amounts of methanol, added to prevent precipitation of formaldehyde polymers (formaldehyde exists in solution as CH2(OH)2 and its polymers HO(CH2O)xH where x averages about three). Formalin free of methanol is also shipped but must be kept warm (about 30 °C (86 °F)) to prevent polymerization. Pure formaldehyde, a gas, is not handled commercially because it tends to polymerize exothermally and may ignite. Vapor from formalin solution is flammable and an explosion hazard when exposed to flame or heat. Skin and eye irritant. Confirmed carcinogen.\\nFormaldehyde is an aldehyde resulting from the formal oxidation of methanol. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, an allergen, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a disinfectant, an environmental contaminant, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a one-carbon compound and an aldehyde.\\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. In solution, it has a wide range of uses: in the manufacture of resins and textiles, as a disinfectant, and as a laboratory fixative or preservative. Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor toxic. (From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717)\\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nFormaldehyde is used mainly to produce resins used in particleboard products and as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals. Exposure to formaldehyde may occur by breathing contaminated indoor air, tobacco smoke, or ambient urban air. Acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to formaldehyde in humans can result in respiratory symptoms, and eye, nose, and throat irritation. Limited human studies have reported an association between formaldehyde exposure and lung and nasopharyngeal cancer. Animal inhalation studies have reported an increased incidence of nasal squamous cell cancer.

Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor toxic. (From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.\\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.\\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function in humans. Lithium-based drugs are useful as a mood stabilizer and antidepressant in the treatment of mental illness such as bipolar disorder.\"]\nA key breakthrough was Schrocks discovery of\nmolybdenumbased complexes capable of binding and reducing dinitrogen to ammonia\nunder ambient conditions.

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Molybdenum-based complexes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dinitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "polyethylenimine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dinitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Molybdenum-based complex", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz. The visible band sits adjacent to the infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies), called collectively optical radiation.\\nIn physics, the term \"light\" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.

It is always found combined with other elements such as oxygen, silicon, and fluorine. Aluminum as the metal is obtained from aluminum-containing minerals. Small amounts of aluminum can be found dissolved in water. Aluminum metal is light in weight and silvery-white in appearance. Aluminum is used for beverage cans, pots and pans, airplanes, siding and roofing, and foil. Aluminum is often mixed with small amounts of other metals to form aluminum alloys, which are stronger and harder. Aluminum compounds have many different uses, for example, as alums in water-treatment and alumina in abrasives and furnace linings. They are also found in consumer products such as antacids, astringents, buffered aspirin, food additives, and antiperspirants.\\nAluminium(0) is an elemental aluminium.\\nA metallic element that has the atomic number 13, atomic symbol Al, and atomic weight 26.98.\\nAluminum is a metallic element in the boron group with atomic symbol Al, atomic number 13, and atomic weight 27.\\nAluminium is a mineral with formula of Al.

Data indicate that aluminum contaminates much of the raw material used to manufacture solutions used for intravenous nutritional support of hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and that pharmaceutical manufacturers have only recently obtained the technology necessary to detect aluminum contamination of their products. As a result, aluminum bypassed normal barriers and entered the blood, accumulating in tissues such as bone, liver and the central nervous system with toxic consequences. Now that the FDA has finally issued a rule governing aluminum contamination in these solutions, manufacturers will need to develop methods to minimize such contamination; scientists should also realize that when data they obtain indicate a serious problem in the manufacturing sector they should be sure that the problem is properly addressed.

It has a density lower than that of other common metals, about one-third that of steel. Aluminium has a great affinity towards oxygen, forming a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. It visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, nonmagnetic, and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al, which is highly abundant, making aluminium the 12th-most abundant element in the universe. The radioactivity of 26Al leads to it being used in radiometric dating.\\nChemically, aluminium is a post-transition metal in the boron group; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The aluminium cation Al3+ is small and highly charged; as such, it has more polarizing power, and bonds formed by aluminium have a more covalent character. The strong affinity of aluminium for oxygen leads to the common occurrence of its oxides in nature. Aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third-most abundant element, after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal. It is obtained industrially by mining bauxite, a sedimentary rock rich in aluminium minerals.\\nThe discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the public with the Hall–Héroult process developed independently by French engineer Paul Héroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In the First and Second World Wars, aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced non-ferrous metal, surpassing copper. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.\\nDespite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to metabolize aluminium salts, but this aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals.

Terminal alkenes are also known as α-olefins.\\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends using the name \"alkene\" only for acyclic hydrocarbons with just one double bond; alkadiene, alkatriene, etc., or polyene for acyclic hydrocarbons with two or more double bonds; cycloalkene, cycloalkadiene, etc. for cyclic ones; and \"olefin\" for the general class – cyclic or acyclic, with one or more double bonds.\\nAcyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups (also known as mono-enes) form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n with n being a >1 natural number (which is two hydrogens less than the corresponding alkane). When n is four or more, isomers are possible, distinguished by the position and conformation of the double bond.\\nAlkenes are generally colorless non-polar compounds, somewhat similar to alkanes but more reactive. The first few members of the series are gases or liquids at room temperature.  The simplest alkene, ethylene (C2H4) (or \"ethene\" in the IUPAC nomenclature) is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially.\\nAromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, however their structure and properties are sufficiently distinct that they are not classified as alkenes or olefins. Hydrocarbons with two overlapping double bonds (C=C=C) are called allenes—the simplest such compound is itself called allene—and those with three or more overlapping bonds (C=C=C=C, C=C=C=C=C, etc.) are called cumulenes.']\nSynthetic strategies towards bbranched amino acids \nA breakthrough was reached upon recognition that the bbranched \namino acid motifs for both 3 and 4 could, in principle, be derived \nfrom aziridine ring openings (Figure 1).

There are non radioactive and radioactive forms of iodine. Iodine is used as a disinfectant for cleaning surfaces and storage containers and is used in skin soaps and bandages, and for purifying water. Iodine is also added to some table salt to ensure that all people in the United States have enough iodine in their diet. Most radioactive iodine is manmade. It is used in medical tests and to treat certain diseases. Most radioactive forms of iodine change very quickly (seconds to days) to stable elements that are not radioactive.

Chemically, iodine is the least reactive of the halogens, and the most electropositive halogen after astatine. However, iodine does not occur in the free state in nature. As with all other halogens , when freed from its compounds iodine forms diatomic molecules (I2). Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography, and dyes. Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Physiologically, iodine exists as an ion in the body. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in have inadequate intakes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, and improves somatic growth.

As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, somewhat brittle, gray metal.\\nCobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since antiquity for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass. The color was long thought to be due to the metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue pigment-producing minerals. They were so named because they were poor in known metals and gave off poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), which was ultimately named for the kobold.\\nToday, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). The element is more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The Copperbelt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production. World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes (114,000 long tons; 128,000 short tons) (according to Natural Resources Canada), and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50%.\\nCobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high-energy gamma rays. Cobalt is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst when refining crude oil. This is to purge it of sulfur, which is very polluting when burned and causes acid rain.\\nCobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins. Vitamin B12, the best-known example of the type, is an essential vitamin for all animals.

It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table: carbon is above it; and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Silicon is a significant element that is essential for several physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Silicon is widely regarded as the predominant semiconductor material due to its versatile applications in various electrical devices such as transistors, solar cells, integrated circuits, and others. These may be due to its significant band gap, expansive optical transmission range, extensive absorption spectrum, surface roughening, and effective anti-reflection coating.\\nBecause of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that Jöns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. Its oxides form a family of anions known as silicates. Its melting and boiling points of 1414 °C and 3265 °C, respectively, are the second highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being surpassed only by boron.\\nSilicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs in its pure form in the Earth's crust. It is widely distributed throughout space in cosmic dusts, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass), after oxygen.\\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, often with very little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional silicate-based soda–lime glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones.\\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age) because of the large impact that elemental silicon has on the modern world economy. The small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (<15%) is essential to the transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as smartphones and other computers. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices, and the semiconductors industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.\\nSilicon is an essential element in biology. Only traces are required by most animals, but some sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and radiolaria, secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.\"]\n.

Catalysts are not consumed by the reaction and remain unchanged after it. If the reaction is rapid and the catalyst recycles quickly, very small amounts of catalyst often suffice; mixing, surface area, and temperature are important factors in reaction rate. Catalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form intermediates that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process of regenerating the catalyst.\\nThe rate increase occurs because the catalyst allows the reaction to occur by an alternative mechanism which may be much faster than the non-catalyzed mechanism. However the non-catalyzed mechanism does remain possible, so that the total rate (catalyzed plus non-catalyzed) can only increase in the presence of the catalyst and never decrease.\\nCatalysis may be classified as either homogeneous, whose components are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the reactant, or heterogeneous, whose components are not in the same phase. Enzymes and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category.\\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical industry of all kinds. Estimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.\\nThe term \"catalyst\" is derived from Greek καταλύειν, kataluein, meaning \"loosen\" or \"untie\".

Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production has risen from about 19 tonnes in 2009 to some 35.5 tonnes in 2017. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemical catalyst. A new application of ruthenium is as the capping layer for extreme ultraviolet photomasks. Ruthenium is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America.
